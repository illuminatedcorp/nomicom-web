<!-- <div>nomicon page</div>
<div>
	what do we want here<br /><br />

	the main page will probably be something like....<br />
	- main character info<br />
	- list of alt characters<br />
	- buttons for character crud<br />
	- a dashboard for important info or something<br />
	- maybe in the future bookmarks or something<br /><br />

	nav at the top will have a link to this base page called Home or something<br />
	illuminated in the center like marketing nav, but smaller? maybe that takes them back to the marketing
	page?<br />
</div> -->

<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-full">This page is under construction.</div>

	// on this request page we want to make new buyback requests

	// information will be pasted into a large text area
	// we'll need to parse the text area into a list of items

	// once we have the item names we can look up the prices
	// will prolly use an evepraisal clone to get the prices

	// once we have the prices we can calculate the total price per item
	// then we sum it up to get the total price of the buyback

	// we need to display the price breakdown to the user
	// we also need to generate a unique ID for the buyback and display that
	// we also want to provide instructions on how to contract the items to us

	// the user sees all this, then confirms by creating the request
	// then are then redirected back to their main page

	// the price of the buyback
	// the items in the buyback, prolly in a dropdown or something
	// the status of the buyback
	// the date of the buyback
	// the ID of the buyback

	// we'll also need to be able to cancel buybacks
	// possible buyback states are
	// pending
	// denied
	// completed
	// cancelled

	// we'll want nav to
	// request a buyback
	// view buyback requests
	// view admin page ONLY IF ADMIN

	// we could also display some metrics over time for admins?
